    description: "Cybersyn compiles common calendars into a single table. Each calendar\
      \ has an ID (calendar_id) for users to select which calendar type they want\
      \ to use. Individual periods within the calendar include period start and end\
      \ dates.\n\nIn addition to period start and end dates, the relevant annual period\
      \ is included in addition to the ordinal position of the period within the annual\
      \ period. For example, and ordinal position of 100 in the daily calendar indicates\
      \ the day is the 100th period in the year.\n\nCalendars include the following\
      \ period types: Day, Week, Month, Quarter, and Year. For Month, Quarter, and\
      \ Year periods, calendars are further broken down to include the traditional\
      \ measures of the periods as well as Retail 4-5-4 calendars for each period\
      \ type. Additionally, the Retail 4-5-4 calendars include the restated periods\
      \ to account for years in which there are 53 weeks."
